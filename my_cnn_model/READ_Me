Link:https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sheep-classification-challenge-2025 
This folder contains a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed to classify sheep breeds based on images.

## üìÑ Files

- `custom_cnn_model.py` ‚Äî the main training script that defines, trains, and evaluates a CNN model using PyTorch.
- `Plots for my CNN.png` ‚Äî training and validation metrics plotted over epochs.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What the Script Does

The script performs the following:

- Loads and preprocesses image data using custom PyTorch Dataset and torchvision transforms.
- Defines a custom CNN architecture with 5 convolutional blocks and dropout for regularization.
- Trains the model over 15 epochs using Adam optimizer and learning rate scheduling.
- Calculates **macro F1-score** on training and validation sets at every epoch.
- Plots training/validation **loss** and **macro F1-score** across epochs.
